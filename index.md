## About Me

<img class="profile-picture" src="media/profile.png">

Hi, I'm Xin, I am joining Facebook as a software engineer in Feb, 2021. I obtained my Master's degree in Computer Science from University of Illinois at Urbana Champaign in 2020, and my B.S. Computer Science degree from New York University (Abu Dhabi) in 2019.

Here is a brief summary of my work experience: I did a remote internship at Facebook during summer 2020 and worked on full-stack Web development in the Ads Measurement org. Previously, I interned at WeChat (Tencent) in Guangzhou during summer 2018 and had some research experience in the Computer Systems and Networking area.

## Work & Research Experience

* **Full-stack Web Development at Facebook** &nbsp; _May - August 20_
  + Set up a new base path and implemented a new server and routing scheme for an advertiser-facing product in Ads Measurement org. Launched the project internally (planned for external launch afterwards).
  + Applied performance optimization techinques to improve the initial page load time of the product.
  + Implemented with ~9k lines of Hacklang(PHP) and JavaScript.
<br/><br/>

* **Undergraduate Thesis on Blockchain-based P2P Storage System** &nbsp; _January - May 19_
  + Faculty advisor: <a href="https://cs.nyu.edu/~jchen/" target="_blank">Jay Chen</a>
  + Designed and partially implemented a blockchain-based P2P data storage system with a decentralized storage verification scheme and networking stack. The storage system is going to support a decentralized online forum application, where each user has the ability to post and moderate content.
  + Wrote a system design white-paper; implemented with ~5k lines of Golang.
<br/><br/>

* **Web Development at <a href="https://mp.weixin.qq.com/cgi-bin/wx" target="_blank">WeChat Mini Program Center</a>, Tencent** &nbsp; _June - August 18_
  + Developed real-time, multiplayer game prototypes using the WeChat Mini Game framework and LayaBox HTML5 game engine. Games are designed so that players join and team up from group chats, boosting the communal experience.
  + Expanded the WeChat Mini Program/Game library by adding APIs to support the latest networking, file storage and multimedia features, such as VoIP chat. Developed feature-testing prototypes that cover each added API.
  + Helped solve developer issues on the community forum for three months.
<br/><br/>

* **P2P Networking Research at Secure Systems Lab, NYU Tandon** &nbsp; _June - August 17_
  + Faculty advisors:
  <a href="https://ssl.engineering.nyu.edu/people#faculty" target="_blank">Justin Cappos</a>,
  <a href="https://ssl.engineering.nyu.edu/people#faculty" target="_blank">Albert Rafetseder</a>
  + Developed a Distributed Hash Table (DHT)-based information advertisement and lookup library for <a href="https://seattle.poly.edu/html/" target="_blank">Seattle Testbed</a>, a cloud computing platform for networking and distributed systems research
  + Followed the BitTorrent BEP5 and BEP44 protocol standards; implemented with ~4k lines of Python.
